An archive of my old webcomic blog. Very egocentric. Meant to be funny.

Was hosted by [alwaysdata](https://www.alwaysdata.com) and powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (a Python web framework). 

Almost ten years later, it finally got to the point where I had to update Python and Django to keep it working. But instead I downloaded everything with [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) and put it up on github pages.

Obviously the blog is not functional anymore, but then it hasn't been functional since 2012, when I had to set the DB to read-only to prevent hordes of spammers to post comments.
